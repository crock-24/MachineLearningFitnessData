# Machine Learning Anaylsis of Accelerometer Data

The goal of this anaylsis is to determine if certain accelerometer sensor data can be used to determine quality exercise movements. 

One possible outcome of this is to let people that wear personal fitness devices know if they are performing an exercise movement well, or to warn people if they are doing a movement incorrectly.
